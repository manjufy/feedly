# Feedly

Feedly - Create your own development book shelf. Organise your knowledge and learning experience and share with others.

## Motivation

Data is the most valuable asset in this moderan era, and we consume so much of information that its hard to keep track of it. As an engineer/developer, I do read, learn something every day from various resources, however, I forget to keep track of the information. Sometimes, at work or having a random conversation with a friend or collague, about a topic, I try to remember or recall the information I read to justify my opinion. But I could hardly could remember even single word from the source. As an engineer, for engineers, would like to build a tool to organise the data and at the same time, share with others as a way to spread the knowledge. Hence Feedly.dev (Writing still in progress)
